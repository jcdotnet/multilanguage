# multilanguage javascript library (a simple way to make your website multilingual)

This is the library I am creating to make some of my projects multilingual, it will allow you to change the UI text to any language you like to without refreshing the page. 

I will share this library so that you can use it if you like. I will also share as soon as possible a very simple test that uses this library.
